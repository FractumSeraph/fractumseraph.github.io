                <p>Something I find myself thinking occasionally is if it's cruel to harm an AI?  Sure, AI doesn't "really" feel pain or have emotions, so if I type "I don't like you." and send it to ChatGPT, you would think it's not really hurting anyone, and I think you would be correct, but how long does that thought process hold up?<br><br>Let's say you are playing a video game. A shooter game where you are supposed to kill enemy NPCs to win. Those NPCs are programmed to <em>not</em> want to get shot. So even though they might not have free will, they do have a will.  They want something, and you are doing the opposite of that.<br>In this example they aren't feeling pain since that has not been programmed into the game. But what about a game like The Sims?  In that game your NPC has stats for happiness, hunger, exhaustion, and other things.  Is it cruel to starve a Sims character?  Most people would probably say no, since they aren't real.  </p>
<p>So my question is at what point does it suddenly become not okay to harm AI?  Nowadays AI can mean many different things. An NPC in a videogame, a Machine Learning language model, a self conscious general intelligence, ect.  This question applies to all of them.<br>This question has been brought up many times in media. Deus Ex Machina. Detroit Become Human. Even a popular Star Trek episode.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?  Where do you draw the line?</p>
